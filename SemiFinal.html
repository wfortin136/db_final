  <h3> Description</h3>
  <p>I decided to implement my project with Ruby on Rails. After some testing on the
  linux server it became clear that the easiest way to deploy using RoR, would be to
  deploy on a server where I had root privelages. Prof. Freeman authorized this as long as
  I followed the same tree structure, /~<username>/CS/mpcs53001/, which I have. 
  As such, I am currently running my UI on my home server built from a Raspberry Pi. 
  The full environment is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hardware: Raspberry Pi 2 Model B</li>
    <li>OS: Raspbian 7; Debian 7 (Wheezy)</li>
    <li>HTTP Server: Apache 2.2.22 (Debian)</li>
    <li>MySQL Server: MySQL 5.5.46-0+deb7u1 (Debian)</li>
    <li>Ruby: Ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Instead of deploying under the full rails framework, I have used Ruby in a very 
  "non-rails" way by not leveraging the MVC rails framework. Instead, I have tried to
  mimic the deployment of php as closely as possible with Ruby.In order to do this, my
  server needed to convert html.erb files into CGI scripts. Once I was able to 
  automatically convert embedded ruby into CGI commands, I could deploy *html.erb
  just like *.php files.</p>
  </p> Additionally, I'm currently in the process of implementing the database within
  rails. This is under the RoR_version directory in the home diretory.This is not
  complete yet, but will provide a much cleaner implementation than the current 
  html.erb files</p>
  <p>All files can be viewed on Github at the following repo: <a href="https://github.com/wfortin136/db_final">DB Final Github Repo </a> </p>
  <p>Current Website url: https://wjf136.ddns.net/~wjf136/CS/mpcs53001/</p>
  <p> One Additional Note: Because I am running this on my home server, I am at the mercy
  of my building network infrastructure as well as internet provider. If there are any
  issues with accessing the url, please contact me immediately at wjf136@uchicago.edu 
  so I can trouble shoot.</p>
